# DRF Blog Back-End App using Generic Views
 This project was done to learn about DRF's class based views and generic class based Views. This is a minimalistic project allowing the user to create , view, update, delete
 posts. 
 
 - To request creating a post, seeing post lists use this url http://127.0.0.1:8000/postings/
 - To update or delete a post, use this url http://127.0.0.1:8000/postings/postid/
 
 In future I plan to add tests, and features to support authentication, multiple users.
